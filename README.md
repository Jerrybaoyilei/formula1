# formula1
CS 5200 code. MySQL for database-related content. Use Java as the language to connect with MySQL. 
A simple data checker for Formula 1 related data. Not yet including the 2023 races. 
Users can also add their favorite drivers and constructors to their account. 

Please see the "CS 5200 final project report.pdf" file I uploaded for the instruction to run the program. Even though the report indicated this as a group project, unfortunately, I did all the work, including writing of the final report. On the bright side, I practiced all the SQL and Java Swing skills needed for this project.
